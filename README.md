# SecretDiary
This is a small project created with php, jQuery(ajax) and Bootstrap. 
All you need 
1)  Sign In with email and create a password (email can be random) 
2)  Switch to 'Log in' mode and use your email and password to log in. 
3) You will see a white text field, enter some text there
At any time you can log out. 
Since all text that you were inputing in that text field was authomatically added to the database, you may log out and after 
log in back you will see the text that you left last time. 
All project is written mostly using php. 
For style I have used Bootstrap and for storing passwords - double md5.
